Weight Lozz - Mobile App
App Overview
Weight Lozz is an Android mobile app designed to help users track their weight and monitor their heart rate during exercise. The app supports users in achieving their fitness goals by providing an easy-to-use platform for logging progress and tracking key health metrics.

Requirements and Goals
The primary goal of Weight Lozz is to provide users with a simple yet effective tool to monitor their weight changes over time and record heart rate during workouts. The app addresses user needs such as:

Tracking daily weight entries for progress visualization.
Monitoring heart rate to optimize exercise intensity.
Viewing historical data to analyze trends and adjust fitness plans.
Screens and Features
Weight Lozz includes the following screens and features:

Home Screen: Displays an overview of the user's weight trends and recent heart rate logs.
Weight Tracker: Allows users to log daily weight entries and view a graph of their progress over time.
Heart Rate Monitor: Provides a space for users to manually enter heart rate readings or sync with compatible devices.
Settings: Lets users customize goals and app preferences.
The UI was designed with the user in mind, focusing on a clean and intuitive layout. Buttons, input fields, and data visualizations are strategically placed to minimize effort and maximize usability. The design incorporates contrasting colors and legible fonts to enhance accessibility.

Coding Approach
The development of Weight Lozz followed a structured approach:

Planning: Defined user stories and prioritized features to meet project goals.
Modular Design: Developed reusable components to simplify future updates and maintenance.
Agile Workflow: Iteratively implemented and tested each feature to ensure functionality and stability.
Third-Party Integration: Used libraries and APIs to enable heart rate synchronization.
This systematic approach allowed for efficient development and robust feature implementation.

Testing Process
To ensure the app's functionality and reliability, the following testing methods were employed:

Unit Testing: Verified individual components like data storage and graph rendering.
Integration Testing: Ensured seamless interaction between the weight tracker, heart rate monitor, and database.
User Feedback: Gathered input from test users to refine the UI and fix usability issues.
Testing revealed minor bugs in the data visualization and syncing logic, which were resolved promptly.

Innovation and Challenges
A key challenge was implementing accurate and visually appealing weight trend graphs. To address this, dynamic chart libraries were used, and customization was applied to ensure the data presentation met user expectations. Additionally, integrating heart rate monitoring posed challenges, requiring careful API selection and data synchronization strategies.

Demonstration of Skills
The Weight Tracker Graph and Heart Rate Monitor Synchronization highlight my skills in:

Android development using Java/Kotlin.
Database management for storing and retrieving user data.
Integrating third-party libraries and APIs.
These components demonstrate my ability to build functional, user-centered applications that combine multiple features seamlessly.

This project reflects my growth in mobile app development and my commitment to creating tools that promote health and fitness through technology.
